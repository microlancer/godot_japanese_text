## How to use

Add the JapaneseText node and set the text and font sizes in the inspector.
To add furigana, enter it within braces after kanji, for example: `駅{えき}の前{まえ}で待{ま}っています`.

## Features

* Uses FlowContainer to allow text to flow naturally.
* When furigana is wider than kanji, additional space is created with the kanji remaining centered.
* Separate kanji sections can be created, e.g. `駅{えき}前{まえ}` instead of only `駅前{えきまえ}`.
* Customize furigana size and main font size.
